# FocusPledge Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** February 2025

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using the FocusPledge application ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

## 2. Description of Service

FocusPledge is a focus and productivity application that uses a skill-based closed-loop virtual economy to incentivize screen time management. Users pledge virtual currency (Focus Credits) on focus sessions, and the outcome depends on whether they successfully avoid distraction during the session.

## 3. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years of age to use the App. By using the App, you represent that you meet this age requirement.

## 4. Account Registration

- You must create an account using Sign in with Apple.
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account.
- You may not share your account with others.
- You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date.

## 5. Virtual Currency & Economy

### 5.1 Focus Credits
- Focus Credits are virtual items purchased with real money through Stripe.
- All purchases are final and non-refundable except as required by applicable law or Apple's App Store policies.
- Focus Credits have **no real-world monetary value** and cannot be exchanged for cash.

### 5.2 Closed-Loop Economy
The App operates a closed-loop virtual economy with the following currencies:

| Currency | How Obtained | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Focus Credits** | Purchased with real money | Pledged on focus sessions |
| **Ash** | Earned when a session fails | Intermediate currency |
| **Obsidian** | Converted from Ash via redemption | Spent in the in-app shop |
| **Frozen Votes** | Created on session failure | Must be redeemed within 24 hours or lost |

### 5.3 Skill-Based System
- Session outcomes are determined entirely by your behavior (whether you use blocked apps during a focus session).
- This is a **skill-based system**, not a game of chance. You have full control over whether you succeed or fail.
- The system uses Apple's Screen Time API to verify compliance.

### 5.4 No Cash-Out
- **Virtual currencies cannot be converted to real money.** There is no cash-out, withdrawal, or transfer mechanism.
- Virtual currencies cannot be transferred between users.
- Obsidian can only be spent on digital items in the in-app shop (themes, badges, icons, titles).

### 5.5 Frozen Votes & Redemption Deadline
- When a pledge session fails, you receive Frozen Votes and a 24-hour redemption deadline.
- You must complete a successful redemption session within 24 hours to convert Ash to Obsidian and rescue Frozen Votes.
- If the deadline expires or the redemption session fails, Frozen Votes are permanently lost.

## 6. Session Rules

- Sessions are enforced using Apple's Screen Time / Family Controls API.
- A session is considered "failed" if you use blocked apps during the session or if the app does not receive heartbeat signals (indicating the monitoring was circumvented).
- Session resolution is performed server-side and is final.
- Attempting to circumvent the monitoring system (e.g., restarting the device, manipulating system time) may result in automatic session failure.

## 7. In-App Shop

- The shop offers cosmetic digital items purchasable with Obsidian.
- All shop purchases are final.
- Shop items are for personal use within the App only.
- Items have no resale or transfer value.

## 8. Payments & Refunds

- All real-money transactions are processed by Stripe.
- Refund requests should be directed to Apple through the App Store, or by contacting us.
- We reserve the right to deny refund requests for Focus Credits that have already been used in sessions.

## 9. Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to:

- Attempt to manipulate, exploit, or circumvent the virtual economy.
- Use automated tools, bots, or scripts to interact with the App.
- Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App.
- Interfere with the App's security features or other users' accounts.
- Use the App for any illegal purpose.

## 10. Intellectual Property

All content, features, and functionality of the App (including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, and software) are owned by FocusPledge and are protected by intellectual property laws.

## 11. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

## 12. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, FOCUSPLEDGE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.

- We may suspend or terminate your account at our discretion for violation of these Terms.
- Upon termination, all virtual currency balances are forfeited.

## 14. Changes to Terms
