## Description

**Take control of your screen time with real stakes.**

FocusPledge is a productivity app that turns focus into a skill-based challenge. Pledge virtual Focus Credits on a timed session, lock away distracting apps using Apple's Screen Time API, and prove you can stay focused. Succeed and get your credits back. Fail and watch them burn into Ash — but don't worry, Ash can be redeemed into Obsidian for exclusive rewards.

**How It Works:**
1. 💰 **Purchase Focus Credits** — Buy credit packs to fund your focus sessions.
2. 🔒 **Pledge & Lock** — Choose a duration, pledge your credits, and lock distracting apps.
3. ⏱️ **Stay Focused** — Avoid blocked apps during your session. It's all on you.
4. ✅ **Succeed** — Get your credits back. Your discipline paid off.
5. 🔥 **Fail** — Credits burn into Ash. Redeem within 24 hours or lose Frozen Votes forever.
6. 💎 **Earn Obsidian** — Convert Ash to Obsidian through redemption sessions.
7. 🛍️ **Shop** — Spend Obsidian on exclusive themes, badges, icons, and titles.

**Key Features:**
• **Skill-Based Economy** — Your results depend entirely on your self-control. No luck, no chance.
• **Apple Screen Time Integration** — Sessions are enforced natively by iOS. No cheating.
• **Closed-Loop Economy** — Focus Credits → Ash → Obsidian → Shop items. No cash-out.
• **24-Hour Redemption Pressure** — Failed sessions create urgency to redeem before Frozen Votes expire.
• **Session History & Stats** — Track your focus streaks, success rate, and transaction history.
• **Beautiful Design** — Clean, modern Material 3 interface with dark mode support.
• **Secure** — Sign in with Apple. Payments via Stripe. Server-side session resolution.

FocusPledge is NOT a gambling app. There is no element of chance. Your focus determines the outcome. Virtual currencies have no real-world monetary value and cannot be cashed out.

**Key Points for Review:**
1. This is a skill-based productivity app, NOT a gambling app. Session outcomes are determined entirely by user behavior (whether they use blocked apps).
2. Virtual currencies (Focus Credits, Ash, Obsidian, Frozen Votes) have NO real-world monetary value and CANNOT be cashed out or transferred.
3. The app uses the Screen Time API (Family Controls / DeviceActivity frameworks) to monitor app usage during active focus sessions only. Screen Time data stays on-device.
4. Payments are for virtual Focus Credits only, processed through Stripe.
5. The closed-loop economy: Real money → Credits → (pledge) → Ash → (redeem) → Obsidian → Shop items. No path back to real money.
