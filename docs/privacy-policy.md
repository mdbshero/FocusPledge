# FocusPledge Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 2025

## Introduction

FocusPledge ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the FocusPledge mobile application ("the App").

## Information We Collect

### Account Information
- **Apple ID Authentication:** We use Sign in with Apple to create your account. We receive your Apple ID user identifier, and optionally your name and email address (if you choose to share them). We do not receive or store your Apple ID password.

### Screen Time Data
- **Screen Time API Usage:** FocusPledge uses Apple's Screen Time API (Family Controls / DeviceActivity frameworks) to monitor app usage during active focus sessions. This data is processed **entirely on your device** by the operating system. We do **not** receive, transmit, or store which specific apps you use.
- **Session Compliance Data:** We record only whether you stayed focused during a session (pass/fail), session duration, and heartbeat timestamps. We do **not** collect detailed app usage logs.

### Financial Information
- **Payment Processing:** Purchases are processed securely by Stripe. We do not store your credit card number or full payment details. We store only: transaction identifiers, purchase amounts, and credit pack information.
- **In-App Economy:** We track your virtual currency balances (Focus Credits, Ash, Obsidian, Frozen Votes) and transaction ledger entries for the in-app closed-loop economy.

### Analytics & Crash Data
- **Firebase Analytics:** We collect anonymized usage analytics (screen views, feature engagement) to improve the App. No personally identifiable information is included in analytics events.
- **Firebase Crashlytics:** We collect anonymous crash reports and error logs to diagnose and fix bugs.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

1. **Provide the Service:** Create and manage your account, process focus sessions, track virtual currency balances, and operate the in-app shop.
2. **Process Payments:** Facilitate credit purchases through Stripe.
3. **Improve the App:** Analyze anonymized usage patterns and fix crashes.
4. **Prevent Abuse:** Enforce session integrity, detect fraudulent activity, and maintain the closed-loop economy.

## Data Storage & Security

- Account and economy data are stored in Google Firebase (Firestore) with security rules that restrict access to authenticated users viewing their own data.
- All data transmission uses HTTPS/TLS encryption.
- Payment data is handled by Stripe in compliance with PCI DSS standards.
- Screen Time enforcement data never leaves your device.

## Data Retention

- Account data is retained as long as your account is active.
- Ledger and session history are retained indefinitely for economy integrity.
- You may request account deletion at any time (see below).
